# Random Walk in 1D

This is a simple Python program that simulates a random walk in one dimension.

A particle starts at position 0 and randomly moves left or right (+1 or -1) at each step.

## How to Use

1. Run the program:

random-walk-paths.py

2. Enter how many steps and how many simulations you want.

It will show the paths and a histogram of final positions.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Install them with:

pip install numpy matplotlib
